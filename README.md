Hi! ðŸ‘‹
I am a researcher in the science of science and computational social science and work as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Collective Learning (CCL), Corvinus University of Budapest.

I have research backgrounds and experience in bibliometrics and altmetrics (social media metrics), my research interests focus on science production and its dissemination inside and outside academia. Specifically, I would like to investigate the role of social media by analyzing scholarly self-promotion to understand the mechanisms behind potential bias, inequality, and disparity. The key research question is whether engaging in social media has the potential chance to break the mechanisms of academia or whether it is the same as the inherent mechanisms of the Matthew effect, where the rich get richer.

Here are some of the research projects that I am currently working on, either on my own or with my colleagues:

(1) Gender inequalities in science production

(2) Science dissemination on social media from the perspective of gender composition.

(3) Science funding and its effects on the behavior of scientists. 

ðŸ˜Š Thank you for your interest in my work!
